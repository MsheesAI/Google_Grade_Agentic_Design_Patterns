## Single-agent system
A single-agent system uses an AI model, a defined set of tools, and a comprehensive system prompt to autonomously handle a user request or to complete a specific task. In this fundamental pattern, the agent relies on the model's reasoning capabilities to interpret a user's request, plan a sequence of steps, and decide which tools to use from a defined set. The system prompt shapes the agent's behavior by defining its core task, persona, and operations, and the specific conditions for using each tool.

The following diagram shows a high-level view of a single agent pattern:
