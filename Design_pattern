Agent patterns : Agent patterns are reusable design templates that describe the structure and behavior of individual agents. 
This includes reasoning agents, retrieval-augmented agents, coding agents, voice interfaces, workflow orchestrators, and collaborative multi-agent systems. 
Each pattern illustrates how agents perceive, reason, act, and learn, mapped to AWS services.

LLM workflows : Workflows focus on how agents use LLMs for reasoning. 
They explore prompting strategies and planning mechanisms, and outline how LLMs are used not only to generate text but also to drive structured,interpretable, 
and reliable behaviors within an agent loop.


Agentic workflow patterns : Workflow patterns describe how multiple agents, tools, and environments interact to form autonomous systems. 
This includes patterns for task orchestration, subagent delegation, event-based coordination, observability, and control. 
These aspects promote scalable, composable, and auditable AI architectures.
